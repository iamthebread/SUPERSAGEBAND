            <br><br><br><br>
            <h3>I'm glad you asked, Supersage is a band truly formed very recently but they actually go back to the start of 2024 when Lead Guitarist and <br><br>
                Vocalist Matthys Zondagh formed the band with former bassist Osiris Bell under the name No Award. Later on Osiris was voted <br><br> 
                out of the band by Matthys, Lester Lei (Guitarist) and Hayley Giles (Drummer). <br><br><br><br>

                Later on Matthys and Hunter Carroll (Current Bassist) got tierd of other members not showing up to practice enough so they decided to form a new <br><br> 
                and focus more heavily on their music. Matthys and Hunter later invited Lester Lei, No Award’s former guitarist to join as the drummer for the band. <br><br><br><br>

                Lester Lei was the drummer, but the band continued to look for a new drummer so Lester could get back on guitar seeing as he is very good. They found <br><br>
                Hayley Giles again, previous drummer of No Award and had her on drums for their first gig then shortly kicked her out due to her never showing up to practices. <br><br> 
                They then renamed to Theory Z and then again to Silvercarp and then to their final name in January 2025, Supersage. Also just before the name change <br><br> 
                they were joined by second guitarist Justin Clokey and Lester went back to drums. <br><br><br><br>
                Supersage soon plans on releasing a short EP album on all platforms and as CDs. Supersage also runs the Lesters Garage gigs for local <br><br>
                alternative bands in Hamilton. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
